# C964

Quick Start Guide

To launch, click the "launch binder" button below. A docker container will gather together the dependencies and code into an image and deploy it to a server where you can interact with the model inside of a web page. Please allow time for this process to occur; it may take up to several minutes. If it does not launch on the first try, please return here and try again.
